This is a BBEdit Codeless Language Module for HAML/SASS.

It is intended to provide sytax coloring, folding, ...
for these lanuages.

These CLM have been rewritten to put them into the modern form (with CDATA)
and the keyword lists were improved.  I welcome all suggestions and comments.

Folded in suggested changes by:
    https://github.com/rogeruiz/BBEdit-CLM-Sass.git

Usage:

Copy the plist files into ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/

NB: Lion has hidden parts of the library as a default. If you cannot seem to find the library, click the Go menu in the finder and hold down the Option key. It should appear. - Thanks JP Wynn

Add a suffix mapping in BBEdit Preferences-> Languages

Enjoy.

This is a BBEdit Codeless Language Module for HAML/SASS.

It is intended to provide sytax coloring, folding, ...
for these lanuages.

Currently this is very alpha.  I welcome all suggestions and comments.

Useage:

Copy the plist files into ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/

Add a suffix mapping in Languages in BBEdit Preferences.

Enjoy.

Matt
